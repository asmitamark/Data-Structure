    "String slicing is a technique in programming languages, especially in Python, that allows you to extract substrings from a given string. It involves specifying a start index, an end index, and optionally a step value.\n",
    "The syntax for slicing is:-\n",
    "string[start:end:step]\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what each parameter means:-\n",
    "- start: The index where the slicing begins. If omitted, it defaults to the beginning of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- end: The index where the slicing ends. The character at this index is not included in the result. If omitted, it defaults to the end of the string.\n",
    "\n",

    "Dictionary keys must be immutable. This is a crucial characteristic because it ensures the integrity and efficiency of the dictionary's data structure.\n",

    "\n",
    "1.Hashing Requirement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries in Python are implemented using a hash table. Hash tables use a hash function to compute an index where the key-value pair should be stored. This index is used to quickly locate the value associated with a given key.\n",

    "\n",
    "Immutable keys ensure that once a key is added to the dictionary, it cannot be altered. This helps maintain the integrity of the dictionary’s internal structure and ensures that the key-value pair relationships remain consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable keys enable dictionaries to perform efficiently in terms of lookups and insertions. Since the hash value of a key does not change, the dictionary can quickly locate the key without worrying about its value being modified.\n",
